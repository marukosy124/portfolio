jobTitle: Software Engineer | Frontend Developer
introduction: >
  Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a software engineer with a passion for frontend development. I'm always looking to challenge myself and learn new things in the software industry. Currently, I'm working at a fintech startup based in Hong Kong, but I'm excited to be continuing my career in Canada this year.

  Building things from scratch is my favorite part of the job - I love the sense of ownership and satisfaction it gives me. Especially when working as a team, it's amazing to see how a group of people with different perspectives and skills can work together to create something wonderful.

  Apart from coding, I'm also a music, movie and fashion lover!
